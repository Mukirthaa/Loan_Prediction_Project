#Project Overview
The aim of this project is to predict whether a loan application will be approved or not based on applicant data. The dataset includes features such as income, credit history, and loan details.

#Key Features
  Preprocessing:
  Handling missing values using imputation.
  Scaling numerical features with StandardScaler.
  One-hot encoding categorical variables.
#Models Implemented:
  Logistic Regression
  Random Forest Classifier
  Decision Tree Classifier
  Gradient Boosting Classifier
 #Evaluation Metrics:
    Accuracy Score
    Confusion Matrix
  Classification Report - (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
#Dataset
  The dataset is included in the repository as loan_approval_dataset.csv. It is sourced from a publicly available Kaggle dataset.
